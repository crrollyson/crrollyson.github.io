<h2>Support and Service Beyond Compare</h2>
<h3>Dedication to Excellence in Customer Service</h3>

<p>In 1976, Jack Henry &amp; Associates was founded on the premise that strong relationships and sound technology go hand&ndash;in&ndash;hand. Today, with more than 10,800 customers and over 6,000 associates, we combine this idea with the pursuit of one common goal &ndash; excellence in financial services.</p>

<p>Ask any of our customers, competitors, or partners what we're best known for. They'll tell you &ndash; customer service. For 40 years, our associates have followed three very simple tenets which have fostered our culture and built our reputation for outstanding customer service:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do the Right Thing</li>
<li>Do Whatever It Takes</li>
<li>Have Fun</li>
</ul>

<p>These core, foundational tenets are a part of every performance review and are constantly reinforced in our business. And with among the strongest financials of any banking core provider, Jack Henry will be around to protect your investment for many years to come.</p>

<p>We hope you'll discover for yourself that the service we provide &ndash; and the spirit with which we'll deal with your bank in every interaction is among the best (if not the best) &ndash; in the industry. If there is ever any way we can better serve your bank, we want to hear from you!</p>
